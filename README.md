### Hey, I'm Scott Kennedy (@scottyzen) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer based in Ireland, focused on building fast, accessible tools and websites using **Vue**, **Nuxt**, and **headless WordPress**.

I maintain [**WooNuxt**](https://github.com/scottyzen/woonuxt), a Nuxt starter for WooCommerce. It was recently mentioned at [Vue.js Amsterdam](https://vuejs.amsterdam) and has seen kind contributions from members of the Nuxt team.  The project just passed **800 stars**, which I'm quietly proud of.

I'm currently working on **ZenBoost AI**, a small tool that gives instant SEO feedback powered by AI â€” no sign-up, just insights.  
Itâ€™s not live yet, but stay tuned â€” nearly there ðŸ˜‰
